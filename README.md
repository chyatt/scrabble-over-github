# Scrabble over GitHub
Experimental scrabble using markdown, python, GitHub actions, and pull requests

## TODO ##
- [ ] Connect the input parameters from manual Deal Tiles action to the command line code that gets executed
- [ ] Send drawn/dealt tiles via email (or secret?) to the player who executes the action
- [ ] Update config options (or secrets?) so that the game can notify the next player
- [ ] Test the system out with a forked repo - can multiple games be happening at once?
- [ ] Encrypt bag so that remaining tiles are obfuscated?
